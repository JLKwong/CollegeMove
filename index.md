# Welcome to College Move

College Move helps over **5.6 million community college students** create a list of colleges for transfer by displaying a tailored college list based on **college quality** (instructional spending per student, faculty-to-student ratio, percentage of full-time faculty, and percentage of	tenured faculty) and **peer diversity** (percentage of students of color, women, and men). Specifically, College Move will show lists of colleges divided into 3 categories: reach, target, and safety.

These data come from IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System), a government database of aggregated data on postsecondary institutions often used by education researchers. The metrics for college quality were chosen based on research measuring the causal effects of colleges on income (*The Returns to College(s): Estimating Value-Added and Match Effects in Higher Education* by Jack Mountjoy and Brent R. Hickman).

# FAQ

**[https://collegemove.sardija.repl.co/](https://collegemove.sardija.repl.co/)**  
By default, the lists in each category will show the colleges that ranked best overall in our analyses first. If you don't feel that a particular college is not a good fit for you, you can scroll down to check out the next best college in that category. You can also personalize these lists using filters.

## Aren't the colleges in your reach list expensive?

All of these colleges will **cover 100% of the cost of attendance** for low-income students, which is less than the cost of community college. You won't have to take a part-time job or student loans to cover your education.

## Isn't it risky to dedicate 4 colleges on my transfer list to reach schools?

Choosing 2 safety schools and 2 target schools already **guarantees that you'll transfer to a college**. The 4 reach schools give you a decent shot at transferring to a college with:
 - Personalized instruction with **lower student-to-faculty ratios** (class sizes averaging 10 or less)
 - More classes offered, career services, internship opportunities, research opportunities, larger libraries, and higher-quality lab equipment with **more spending per student** ($50,000+ per year)
 - High-quality instruction with **more full-time, tenured professors** who are experts in their fields (80%-100% full-time, ~33% tenured)
 - Networking opportunities with **high-achieving and influential peers**

## Does College Move collect my data?
No. We tailor college lists based on generic criteria that you can change in the filters. We do not ask for any personal information or otherwise collect any data to filter the College Move list.
 
## Where can I find the source data?
