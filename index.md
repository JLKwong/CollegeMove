# Welcome to College Move

College Move helps 5.6 million community college students create a list of colleges for transfer by displaying a tailored college list based on college quality (instructional spending per student, faculty-to-student ratio, percentage of full-time faculty, and percentage of	tenured faculty) and peer diversity (percentage of POC, women, and men). These data come from IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System), a government database of aggregated data on postsecondary institution often used by education researchers.
